The elasticsearch-operator has been installed into the cluster.

All nodes that have the potential to run the elasticsearch container
should have the following added to its sysctl settings:

    vm.max_map_count = 262144

Failure to set vm.max_map_count to at least the value above will
cause the elasticsearch containers to constantly exit.
